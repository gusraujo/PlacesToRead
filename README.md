# PlacesToRead
The project is a web application designed for book enthusiasts who want to share and discover inspiring locations for reading. Imagine finding the perfect spot to cozy up with your favorite book, whether it's in a welcoming caf√©, a serene park, or a charming library.

With "placesToRead," users can:

- Explore and share ideal reading locations.
- Add descriptions and images of their favorite places.
- Rate and comment on reading spots to help fellow enthusiasts.
- Create a personal list of places to read they wish to visit.
- Connect with other readers and share reading recommendations.


This project is built using modern technologies, including Kotlin and the Spring Framework, to create a user-friendly and interactive experience. We believe that every place has a story to tell and offers a unique reading experience, and we're excited to build a community of passionate readers who want to share these discoveries.
